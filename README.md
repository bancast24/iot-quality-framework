# IoT Quality Framework

This repository contains two experimental pipelines for evaluating quality improvements in IoT environments using machine learningâ€“based metric weighting.

## 1. Smart Agriculture Simulation

This experiment simulates a smart farming scenario using synthetic sensor data. It applies Random Forest regression to assign weights to key performance indicators and evaluates the impact on overall quality scores.

## 2. Smart Industrial Quality Evaluation

This experiment validates the framework using real-world data from the ToN-IoT dataset. It compares baseline performance metrics with weighted quality scores across industrial environments.
