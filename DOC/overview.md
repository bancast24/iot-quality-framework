# Project Overview

## Title: IoT Quality Evaluation Framework

This project implements a validated, context-aware framework for evaluating the quality of IoT systems across multiple operational domains. It integrates simulation data, machine learning, and statistical analysis to assess service-level performance in both synthetic and real-world environments.


## Objectives

- Apply a multidomain evaluation model to IoT systems
- Use classified quality indicators and learned weights to compute SLA-based quality scores
- Validate the framework through agricultural simulation and industrial data analysis
- Quantify improvements using statistical significance and effect size


## Domains Covered

The framework evaluates five operational domains:
- Device-level performance
- Network behavior
- Environmental monitoring
- Sensor data integrity
- Service delivery quality

## Evaluation & Results

- Smart Agriculture Simulation
  Quality improved by 16% using weighted indicators
  p = 0.0003, Cohenâ€™s d = 1.84

- Smart Industrial Evaluation
  Quality improved by 12% using weighted indicators
  p = 0.00001, Cohenâ€™s d = 1.76

Outputs include:
- `.txt` files with statistical results
- `.png` charts comparing baseline vs weighted scores


## Future Work

- Extend to smart healthcare, smart cities, and other IoT domains
- Integrate real-time data streams and anomaly detection
- Explore federated learning and Quality 4.0 models
- Enhance context-awareness and adaptive evaluation
